# refactor1
I refactored this website to make it mroe accessible. All three links now work and the footer area is smaller than before due to it being not as important. On the inside I've added comments to what I've changed, most changes were to fix semantic issues. Another change I made is adding a proper title to the website. There should be a screenshot and link of the deployed website down below.
